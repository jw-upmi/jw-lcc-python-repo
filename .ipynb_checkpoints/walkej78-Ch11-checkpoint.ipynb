    "    • Screen record work using SnagIt to demonstrate the iterative process. The recording should include audio that walks through your thoughts as you craft a solution. This component of your grade will be reflected in your iteration grade in the rubric.\n",

    "    The workday is divided into two shifts: day and night. The shift attribute will hold an integer value representing the shift that the employee works. The day shift is shift 1 and the night shift is shift 2. Write the appropriate accessor and mutator methods for each class.\n",

    "    Once you have written the classes, write a program that creates an object of the <b>ProductionWorker</b> class and prompts the user to enter data for each of the objects data attributes.

    "2. <b>ShiftSupervisor</b> Class<br>In a particular factory, a shift supervisor is a salaried employee who supervises a shift. In addition to a salary, the shift supervisor eams a yearly bonus when his or her shift meets production goals. Write a <b>ShiftSupervisor</b> class that is a subclass of the <b>Employee</b> class you created in Erogramming Exercise 1 . The <b>ShiftSupervisor</b> class should keep a data attribute for the annual salary, and a data attribute for the annual production bonus that a shift supervisor has earned. Demonstrate the class by writing a program that uses a <b>ShiftSupervisor</b> object.\n",

Next, write a class named <b>Customer</b> that is a subclass of the Person class. The <b>Customer</b> class should have a data attribute for a customer number, and a Boolean data attribute indicating whether the customer wishes to be on a mailing list. Demonstrate an instance of the <b>Customer</b> class in a simple program."
