    "Please complete TWO questions from the Programming Exercises section of Chapter 10 of your textbook using a Jupyter Notebook or VS Code (paired with frequent commits to GitHub) or Google Colaboratory (paired with cells that build up solutions iteratively or access to your revision history). There are fewer problems, but you have more components that must be included with each solution.\n",

    "In preparation for the practical component of your final exam, students must also complete the following additional components for each solution:\n",
    "   - Screen record work using SnagIt to demonstrate the iterative process. The recording should include audio that walks through your thoughts as you craft a solution. This component of your grade will be reflected in your iteration grade in the rubric.\n",
    "   - Create and leverage at least one custom module for each solution. This component of your grade will be reflected as one third of your functionality grades in the rubric.\n",
    "   - Create at least one diagram (either a flowchart or a hierarchy chart or a UML diagram) for each solution. that details aspects of your solution. This component will be reflected in your explanation grade in the rubric.\n",

Of note, you may use ChatGPT to troubleshoot code that isn't working to come up with a functioning solution, but I want to see evidence of attempts by you to get something started on your own.
